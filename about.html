<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My nameis Victoria and I am a cloud engineer who became a tech engineer and I love working with technologies and
  learning about new technologies as well. My goal in life is to become a billionaire, while that might seem far fetched
  as I do not currently have hundreds of thousands, I do however, strongly believe that I am a billionaire because I
  have all that is required to become one.</p>

<p>I am giving my time and resources to learning the skills and adding so much value to my life that would eventually
  lead me to making the billions that I so desire because there is no such thing as something for nothing atleast not
  that I'm aware of in my 30 plus years on earth.</p>


<p>I know is supposed to be about who I am currently not who I want to become but I believe in affirmations and hardwork
  to bring it to pass, so why wait to talk about the future when you can just claim it now and keep working towards it.
  Anyways, I am your go to girl for website development and I make sure you get the value for your money! Ring me up or
  send an email through my contact me link below.</p>
